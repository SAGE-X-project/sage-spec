# sage-inspector conformance plan

Target specification: **0.10.0**. Implementation owner:
`/Users/0xtopaz/work/github/sage-x-project/sage-inspector`.
This is a test contract, not executable tests or passed results. The current
inspector is reference evidence only; no code changes are made in this delivery.

## 1. Evidence model

[traceability.json](traceability.json) is the machine-readable requirement → rule
→ case mapping. Each case includes an input/scenario, preconditions, expected
outcome, mode and `planned_not_executed` status. A future case may expand into
several concrete independent vectors. Do not generate expected values using only
the implementation being tested, or count the old vector version as new evidence.

A future inspector report contains protocol/profile version, case ID, subject
repository/revision, runner/environment version, immutable input digest, expected
and actual verdict, state/effect counters, and evidence locations. Report PASS,
FAIL, UNSUPPORTED, NOT_RUN separately. Absence, skipped tests and wire-only checks
cannot certify host isolation or full Execution Guard.

## 2. Required test harness capabilities (future implementation)

Use synthetic test identities and isolated disposable effects, never production
keys or external live state. An executor fixture records dispatch count and exact
arguments, supports crash before/after reservation/commit, controls clocks and
registry snapshots, and coordinates concurrent replicas. Verify errors as well as
success: a generic remote failure must not leak local detailed authentication causes.

For all closed schemas expand mutation cases across every field: missing, null,
wrong type, duplicate, unknown member, lower/upper size boundary and one byte beyond;
for every authenticated field mutate independently. Exercise malformed UTF-8,
base64/JWK/scalars, canonical JSON number and Unicode corners. At every specified
expiry/rotation boundary test just below, exactly at, just above and concurrent arrival.

Network tests must distinguish signature verification from authorisation, response
binding and execution ledger acceptance. Test HTTP/WS where specified, direct local
MCP Execution Guard separately, and nested gates once per logical call. A valid
signature on an unsafe model proposal is a negative control, not a crypto failure.

## 3. Integration families referenced by charter

| Family | Main rule groups | Required evidence |
|---|---|---|
| IG-01 | EXEC-02, EXEC-03 | Trusted capture and authorised original/derived linkage |
| IG-02 | EXEC-03, EXEC-04 | Mutated intent rejected before dispatch |
| IG-03 | EXEC-01, EXEC-04, EXEC-08 | Missing/skipped/timed-out verifier always blocks |
| IG-04 | EXEC-06 | Baseline and check/load race protection |

## 4. Case catalogue

The JSON contains one positive/review case and individual negative cases for each
semicolon-separated variant below. Values and expected verdicts are determined by
the referenced normative group. Cases are planned, not run. Pure document review
cases report nonconformance rather than sending meaningless network fixtures.

## 5. Existing evidence and gaps

The six historical suites under `vectors/` contain 26 cases at
`1.0.0-draft.1`. Retain them unchanged. The current inspector and code paths are
linked by the [evidence graph](../analysis/graphs.md); historical reports are not
relabelled as current pass results. New domains, envelopes, timing, registry and
execution semantics require new fixtures and adapters in follow-up work.

## 6. Security analysis and measurements (not wire tests)

Model the HPKE transcript, both ephemeral contributions, signing/KEM key status,
key confirmation, interleaving, unknown-key-share and post-session compromise in
Tamarin or ProVerif (tool choice remains an implementation decision). The acceptance
claim must name assumptions, secrecy/agreement properties, counterexamples and
proof status; RFC composition alone is not proof. Model ledger crash/replay safety
separately from a transactional tool's business exactly-once guarantees.

Measure registration, authoritative resolution and revocation publication/observation
latencies separately, including chain finality and clock assumptions. Report operation
cost, payload size, throughput and percentile latency with repetitions, hardware,
network, fixture and source revision. Compare SAGE/no-SAGE demos under the same
policy and sandbox, and explicitly show validly authorised unsafe-content controls.
No measurements, proof or live conformance run were performed in this delivery.

## 7. Follow-up implementation order

Implement stable parsing and independently checked vectors, then core wire and
state tests, then HTTP/WS cross-core exchange, then host-specific Execution Guard
fault injection. Registration/lookup convenience services and demos consume the
same contracts. Do not start actual repository migration as a side effect of this
plan; follow the [separate migration design](../architecture/migration-plan.md).

## 8. Contract closure review — 2026-09-14

CST-01..05 are resolved at the document-contract level; see the
[closure and re-review](crypto-trust-closure.md). Inspector implementation may
proceed against this revised snapshot; that is not a passed implementation or
security certification. Independent composition and host-isolation evidence remain
release gates. No Inspector code has been started.

## 9. Added closure scenarios

The original 358 cases are retained. The following 28 explicit cases bring the
catalogue to **386 planned cases**; all remain `planned_not_executed`. These cases
supplement section 4 rather than changing historical case IDs. Exact scenarios and
expected outcomes are in [traceability.json](traceability.json).

| Case | Rule | Scenario | Required outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| CST-01-01 | EXEC-05 | Duplicate versus intact absence/lost ledger | Existing call returns pending without redispatch; intact absence permits original execution once; lost ledger denies. |
| CST-01-02 | EXEC-07 | Pending then completion | Accept completed once for the tracked call; outer response binds the new invocation; no second response to the first invocation. |
| CST-01-03 | EXEC-07 | Delayed pending after terminal | Ignore the verified delayed pending; do not reopen the call or consume more output. |
| CST-01-04 | EXEC-07 | Conflicting terminal reply | Reject conflict; preserve first outcome. Identical terminal envelope is ignored. |
| CST-01-05 | EXEC-05 | UNKNOWN versus ordinary waiting | Live entry yields pending; recovered entry yields stored signed unknown once available and never auto-dispatches. |
| CST-01-06 | EXEC-05 | Changed inner proof on retry | Reject nonidentical envelope and leave the existing operation unchanged; client must retain original proof. |
| CST-01-07 | EXEC-08 | HTTP and MCP pending mapping | Empty output; MCP isError=true and matching canonical structured/text values; wire success=false,error=unavailable. An unsigned unavailable error authorizes nothing. |
| CST-01-08 | EXEC-05 | Expiry and polling frequency | First may return a snapshot; equality fails freshness without redispatch; trusted Client does not issue the too-fast poll. No new call ID bypass. |
| CST-01-09 | EXEC-07 | Rejection persistence race | Only a terminal no-dispatch ledger entry can publish rejected; an existing reservation cannot be overwritten. A recorded rejection cannot later execute. |
| CST-01-10 | EXEC-07 | Terminal result expires or key revoked | Fail retrieval without refreshing, re-signing, or executing. Retain historical outcome for protected reconciliation. |
| CST-02-01 | EXEC-02 | Policy descriptor canonical commitment | JCS descriptor bytes and domain-separated SHA-256 match the published commitment; array/file byte order is not normalized. |
| CST-02-02 | EXEC-02 | Policy artifact mutation | Pinned-artifact validation fails; no signing/dispatch under the old approved commitment. |
| CST-02-03 | EXEC-02 | Retirement versus dispatch | A single serialized gate orders them: retirement first yields zero dispatch; already committed effect is not described as rolled back. |
| CST-02-04 | EXEC-02 | Ledger-loss epoch recovery | Unsynchronized scope remains fail-closed; resume only after all affected old commitments are rejected and the new mapping is durable. |
| CST-02-05 | EXEC-02 | Peer self-provisions policy | Deny; incoming material cannot install a mapping. Reusing an old epoch for restored bytes is not valid administration. |
| CST-03-01 | SESSION-03 | AAD exact boundary | Complete AAD is4096 bytes and is within sender/receiver limits. |
| CST-03-02 | SESSION-03 | AAD one byte over | Complete AAD4097 is rejected by sender and receiver before AEAD; metadata allowance does not override it. |
| CST-04-01 | SESSION-01 | Wrong participant with valid crypto | Reject pinned tuple mismatch before acceptance; valid crypto is not sufficient. |
| CST-04-02 | SESSION-01 | Same DID alternative active key | Reject; switching keys requires a fresh handshake. |
| CST-04-03 | SESSION-01 | Recipient or role mismatch | Reject each mismatch; no replay/state acceptance or application effects. |
| CST-04-04 | SESSION-01 | Bound key revoked versus unrelated update | Revocation closes without substitution. Unrelated update alone leaves the pinned active tuple usable; new handshake selects current KEM. |
| CST-05-01 | HPKE-05 | First record before deadline | Atomically reserve transport nonce/id and seq and establish once, then separately evaluate tool authorization. |
| CST-05-02 | HPKE-05 | Exact pending deadline | Each equality closes/rejects; no grace or dispatch. |
| CST-05-03 | HPKE-05 | Forged first record | Do not reserve replay state or establish; remain provisional unless separate local closure applies. |
| CST-05-04 | HPKE-05 | Concurrent first records | Identical copy accepted once; distinct valid records may both be accepted but only one establishes and both obey separate execution authorization. |
| CST-05-05 | HPKE-05 | Policy-denied authenticated first record | Session is established and cryptographic replay state retained; zero protected tool effects; permitted encrypted rejection does not unconfirm. |
| CST-05-06 | HPKE-05 | First record after sequence loss | Confirm if otherwise valid and before deadline; do not require seq0 or reset counters. |
| CST-05-07 | SESSION-02 | Confirmation does not extend session age | Confirmation does not restart session absolute/idle lifetime; only specified accepted traffic resets idle. |

## Adopted non-HTTP MCP binding plan

The current traceability file retains all 386 baseline case IDs and 71 original
binding parents under MSET-01..08 and MOWN-01..06. The revised profile adds nine
planned binding parents for local configuration and one active protected exchange
per owner. Its 26 mandatory child assertions are obligations inside those parents,
not an extra top-level test count. Run each in
its declared scope: the isolated 1024-entry owner bound is a unit seam; authenticated
traffic must stop at the tighter session-record ceiling. Every added parent/child
remains planned or NOT_RUN. Older 37-case Inspector lifecycle evidence is a separate
catalog and is neither added nor automatically mapped into this 471-case plan.
The earlier 457-case snapshot and its 71-case Inspector overlay retain their pinned
historical revision; none of the nine new cases inherits PASS evidence.
The preserved MCP errata snapshot has 466 planned parents. The current
coordinated revision adds five planned parents for independently authorized
Agent hops and DID/JWK interoperability boundaries. Its 471 parents remain
unexecuted as a plan; no historical Inspector result is promoted. The added
cases are `mrevision-hop-authorized`, `mrevision-hop-unapproved`,
`mrevision-parent-no-grant`, `mrevision-did-consumer` and
`mrevision-extra-jwk-authority`.
